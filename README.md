**RuneLite - Extended**

This is a forked runelite client of [here](https://github.com/runelite/runelite).
In this repository I have commited some personal plugins that I have been working on/am working on.
So far this is the list of custom plugins compared to the original client:

- **StatsStalker** - This plugin enables to track your progress vs your friends or another players on runescape. It displays a widget with level information compared to yours and shows the XP differences.

## Usage

Open the project in your IDE as a Maven project, build the root module and then run the RuneLite class in runelite-client.
